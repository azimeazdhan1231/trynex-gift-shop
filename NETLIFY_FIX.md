# ðŸ”§ Netlify Deployment Fix

## Issue Fixed
Your Netlify deployment was showing "404 Page not found" because:
1. The publish directory was set to `dist` instead of `dist/public`
2. Frontend static files are generated in `dist/public/` by Vite

## Solution Applied
âœ… **Updated netlify.toml**
- Changed publish directory from `dist` to `dist/public`
- SPA redirect rules already configured correctly

## Manual Fix for Existing Netlify Deployment

If you have an existing Netlify deployment, update these settings:

### Option 1: Update via Netlify Dashboard
1. Go to your Netlify site dashboard
2. **Site settings** â†’ **Build & deploy** â†’ **Build settings**
3. Change **Publish directory** from `dist` to `dist/public`
4. Click **Save**
5. **Deploys** â†’ **Trigger deploy** â†’ **Deploy site**

### Option 2: Redeploy from GitHub
1. Push the updated code with fixed `netlify.toml`
2. Netlify will automatically detect the new configuration
3. New deployment will use `dist/public` as publish directory

## Verify Fix
After deployment, your site should:
- âœ… Load the homepage correctly
- âœ… Handle client-side routing (no 404s on refresh)
- âœ… Admin panel accessible at `/admin`
- âœ… Connect to backend API for data

## Files Updated
- `netlify.toml` - Fixed publish directory
- `DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md` - Updated instructions
